This repository explores two aspects of estimating discrete choice
models to value environmental goods and services:

1.  Experimental Design for Choice Experiments
2.  Estimation of Discrete Choice and Limited Dependent Variable models

I want to be very clear here (and will try to periodically remind you
throughout the module) that I am not a subject matter expert when it
comes to choice experiments, discrete choice modeling, limited dependent
variable econometrics, or any related topics. I am providing this
content because I recognize the central role that choice experiments and
discrete choice modeling play in the overarching NMFS mission to promote
ecosystem-based resource management.

I have segmented this repository into 3 lessons that showcase R
functionalities addressing 3 important choice experiment adjacent
topics:

1.  experimental design for choice experiments using fractional
    factorial designs
2.  experimental design for choice experiments using statistically
    optimal designs
3.  estimation of discrete choice models.

1.  [Experimental-Design-for-DCMS-Factorial-Designs.Rmd](https://github.com/aaronmams/rHD-Choice-Experiments/blob/master/Experimental-Design-for-DCMs-Factorial-Designs.Rmd)
    focuses on illustrating functions in the R package
    [support.CEs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/support.CEs/support.CEs.pdf)
    to generate fractional factorial designs for choice experiments.

2.  [Experimental-Design-for-DCMs-Optimal-Designs.Rmd](https://github.com/aaronmams/rHD-Choice-Experiments/blob/master/Experimental-Designs-for-DCMS-Optimal-Designs.Rmd)
    illustrates some features of the [idefix
    package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/idefix/index.html)
    which facilitates use of Bayesian methods for generating efficient
    designs for choice experiments.
